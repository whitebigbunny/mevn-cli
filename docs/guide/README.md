# Getting Started

## What is MEVN-CLI ?

A CLI tool for getting started with the MEVN stack. It offers a super simple boilerplate template and additional utilities for building a MEVN stack based webapp. It takes away the hassle of setting up the local development environment which may become a nightmare especially for beginners who are just starting out.

## Why MEVN-CLI ?

As per the traditional approach, Developers are required to make their hands dirty setting up the local development environment which can be a pain especially for beginners (as mentioned above). Also, it consumes time which can be utilised in building the actual product. We can also see this in the deployment phase where they may face trouble. All these can serve as demotivating factors for novices. It is here where MEVN-CLI comes into play. It offers a super simple boilerplate project, a reliable boilerplate for pwa, GraphQL, Nuxt-js and additional utilities for building a MEVN stack app.

The main aim of MEVN-CLI is to make Developers productive such that all they require is to focus on building the actual product while it takes care of all the local development environment setup as well . Significant features include:-

- Choose the template of your choice:- The user has the provision to choose from a basic, PWA, Nuxt-js and GraphQL template which serves as a platform to build upon. The user has the provision to choose between his database of choice (Mongo DB / MySQL) where in which mongoose and sequelize serves as the ODM and ORM respectively.

- Run your application within a Docker container:- With MEVN-CLI all the user has to do is fire in a single command with which it pulls in the required docker image and your web-app will be served locally within a Docker container.

- Add additional packages as required on the go Just fire in a command with which you can add additional packages like vuetify, vuex-store etc. It also allows to create components with a single command.
